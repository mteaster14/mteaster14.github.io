            <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Good Website: <a href = "https://cci.charlotte.edu/" target = "_blank">UNC Charlotte CCI</a></h3>
            <p>UNC Charlotte's CCI page is the for the College of Computing and Informatics. This page will lead you to everything you need to know about this program. Here are some 
                reasons I think this is a good website.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Even though the main page is mostly white, the green in the header and elsewhere really make the page stand out.
                    The yellow as well in the navigation links at the very top goes well with the green.</li>
                <li>Repetition: The repetition on this page is good. Sizes of images and words stay consistent making everthing 
                    look clean.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Almost everything on this page has a centered allignment making it easy to read. The margins on the side are thin 
                    so there isn't a lot of empty space on the page.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Things on this page that should be grouped together are. The are side by side and centered on each side.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Bad Website: <a href = "https://www.art.yale.edu/" target = "_blank">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
            <p>Yale School of Art is a webpage used for the school of arts at Yale. This page is supposed to help you guide your way 
                to find everthing you need to know about this school.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The contrast on the page isn't horrible. There is a dark patterned background and all the text boxes are mostly a 
                    light color making it easy to read. There is however a lot of colors on this page and it makes it hard to read. At some 
                    point on the page there are black divider lines that you can't really see because of the dark background</li>
                <li>Repetition: There doesn't seam to be a lot of repetition on this page. There is no color scheme, size repetion, nothing. The colors
                    are all over the place.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Everything is alligned to the left side of the page leaving a lot of empty space on the page. </li>
                <li>Proximity: I would say proximity is probably the best thing on this page. Everything seems to be in the same proximity.</li>
            </ul>
