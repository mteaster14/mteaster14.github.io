            <h2>Contract</h2>
            <p>
                I, Mackenzie G Teaster agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2022, ITIS 3135, Web Application Design and Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
            </p>
            <p>
                I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where i have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates
            </p>
